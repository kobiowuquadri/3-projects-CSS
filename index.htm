          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at
            Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent. I worked on Places for
            Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve communication
            and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work
            with the Places for Project Teams product throughout an entire
            software lifecycle-from initial product conception through the
            actual product launch. <br />
            <br />

            I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I
            specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on process
            support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree
            from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, and
            bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
            <br />

        At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore
        core class, and Software Processes, a graduate seminar. I also worked as
        a peer academic advisor, a freshmen orientation advisor, and served on
        leadership for campus chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and Inter
        Varsity Christian Fellowship.

                Are you thinking about trying
                <a href="#">rock climbing?</a> Climbing is a fun and challenging
                sport that has a surge of popularity in recent years. Almost
                anyone can climb: you don't need a high level of strength or
                fitness to get started. Gear is available for men, women, and
                children of all shapes and sizes, and most gyms will allow
                children as young as three to climb. Climbing is not about brute
                force. Climbing more difficult routes does take some strength,
                mostly in your legs and hands, but it also takes skill and
                problem-solving ability. <br />
                <br />
                Oh, and it is okay if you are afraid of heights. Really. Just
                keep your eyes on the wall.
